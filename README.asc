== About

The underlying library for Develhack.

This library provides following features.

* xref:annotations_packaged_assertion[Annotations for representing assertion].
* xref:annotations_packaged_feature[Annotations for representing feature].
* xref:methods_prefixed_is[Functions for condition determination].

== Description

[[annotations_packaged_assertion]]
=== Annotations for representing assertion

The annotations included in `com.develhack.annotation.assertion` package represents assertion of method arguments and properties.

These annotations are intended primarily for documentation, but it is also possible to evaluate by reflection at run time.

[[annotations_packaged_feature]]
=== Annotations for representing feature

The annotations included in `com.develhack.annotation.feature` package represents feature of classes.

These annotations are intended primarily for documentation, but it is also possible to evaluate by reflection at run time.

[[methods_prefixed_is]]
=== Functions for condition determination

The static methods prefixed by `is` that defined in the `com.develhack.Conditions` provides utility functions for determining a condition.


[[methods_prefixed_check]]
=== Functions for asserting pre-condition

The static methods prefixed by `check` that defined in the `com.develhack.Conditions` provides utility functions for check pre-condition.

If violating the pre-conditions, these methods throw the `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException` with an appropriate message.
